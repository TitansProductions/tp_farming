# TP Farming

## DEVELOPMENT API

### EXPORTS

@HasAttachedEntityBucket
Why using this export? This export can be used for scripts to prevent breaking the animation and the bucket attachment if the players are breaking it in purpose.

```lua
exports.tp_farming:HasAttachedEntityBucket() -- returns boolean (true / false) and the entity id if boolean is true.
```
