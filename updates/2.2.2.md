# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. Added an extra feature for temperature system to display current plant temperature before placing it (below press to cancel - press to place). This way, the players will be aware of the real temperature of the plant. Personally, because before placement they dont know what temperature a plant supports as min-max, in your case i would display min-max temperatures on each seed items description.
2.
3. ## Modified Files:

- client/tp-client_placements.lua
- locales.lua
- fxmanifest.lua

## Notes

- Add on `locales.lua` file the new locale below 'PLANT_PLACE_1'
  
```lua

    ['PLANT_PLACE_TEMPERATURE']    = "Current plant temperature: %s°C", -- version 2.2.2

```

## How to update?

- You can easily update the modified files by redownloading from the **Cfx.re Portal** and copy-paste on the mentioned directory file paths.
- If new options have been implemented to the configuration file or edited, **DO NOT** copy-paste the new configuration file, otherwise you will get the latest configuration but you will lose all the changes you have made. The proper way updating a configuration file is by finding the new configuration options or the modified ones and do it **manually**.

*Cfx.re Portal **DOES NOT** force-update your configuration file or any files, if it did, you would always lose all the configuration changes you made or would totally break the script, all files are updated or edited manually.*
